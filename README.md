# HorseOrHuman-CNN
This repository contains code to classify Horses from Human images using CNN on a Raspberry Pi Zero. The Keras model is available in this repo (https://github.com/debjyotiC/Coursera-TF/blob/master/intro-to-TF/week-4.py), which is converted to TensorFlow Lite model for the Raspberry Pi Zero to be able to run it.
